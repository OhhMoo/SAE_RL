# SAE × RL: Qwen2.5-0.5B on GSM8k

Warm-start TopK SAEs trained on 8 PPO checkpoints × 4 residual-stream layers of Qwen2.5-0.5B-Instruct fine-tuned on GSM8k. Purpose: measure what RL changes inside the model.

## What I did

1. **PPO** on Qwen2.5-0.5B-Instruct on GSM8k with a flexible reward (last number in the response = correct). 2 GPUs, `verl` FSDP + vLLM rollout. Checkpointed every 10 steps; ran to step 200.
2. **Collected residual-stream activations** at layers {6, 12, 18, 23} from 8 stages — `instruct_base` and `ppo_step{10,30,60,100,140,180,200}` — 2M tokens per (stage, layer).
3. **Trained 32 warm-start TopK SAEs** (8 stages × 4 layers). Each stage's SAE is initialised from the previous stage's weights, so feature indices align across checkpoints and decoder-cosine drift is meaningful.
4. **Evaluated** SAE quality on a held-out 20% activation split (seeded shuffle): normalized MSE (`MSE / Var(x)`) and fraction of CE-loss recovered on GSM8k test prompts (`(L_mean − L_sae) / (L_mean − L_base)`).

| | |
|---|---|
| Layers | 6, 12, 18, 23 |
| Max sequence length | 512 |
| Batch size | 16 |
| Tokens per (stage, layer) | 2,000,000 (≈ 445,744 token positions) |

## Quality

Evaluated on the held-out 20% of activations (89,148 rows per (stage, layer)) and 100 GSM8k test prompts.

- **NMSE** = `MSE / Var(x)` pooled over all elements of the val activations. Lower is better; 0 = perfect reconstruction.
- **frac_rec** = `(L_mean − L_sae) / (L_mean − L_base)` where `L_base` is the model's CE on GSM8k test prompts untouched, `L_sae` is the CE with `sae(x)` spliced in at the layer (real-token positions only; padding pass-through), and `L_mean` is the CE with the layer's real-token mean spliced in (control). 1 = SAE recovers all the loss that a mean ablation would have lost; 0 = no better than the dataset mean.

| Layer | NMSE (range across 8 stages) | frac_rec (range) |
|---|---|---|
| 6  | 0.0004 – 0.0005 | 0.981 – 0.989 |
| 12 | 0.0007 – 0.0009 | 0.960 – 0.967 |
| 18 | 0.0034 – 0.0038 | 0.937 – 0.965 |
| 23 | 0.288 – 0.305   | 0.946 – 0.959 |

Layer 23 has noticeably higher NMSE than other layers, but mean ablation at L23 destroys the model (L_mean ≈ 15–20 nats vs `L_base` ≈ 2.4–3.2 nats), so frac_rec stays at 0.95+ — the unrecovered variance lives in low-importance directions for the LM head. Layer 18 frac_rec drifts down ~3pp across PPO training (0.965 at step10 → 0.937 at step200) while NMSE stays flat; layers 6 and 12 are stable across the chain.
